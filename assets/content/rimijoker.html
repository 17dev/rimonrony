"<span id="k">Hey.</span>" <br />
This is <strong>Rimon Rony</strong>.

<p>
I’ve been around AI and Machine Learning for many years — back when it wasn’t a buzzword.
Built things, sold some, failed at others, and kept learning.
</p>

<p>
These days I work with others to build and scale intelligent systems.
</p>

<p>
I don’t do much on LinkedIn, social media, X, or Twitter — I’m pretty introverted.
Sometimes I do keynotes for my community when something’s worth sharing.
</p>

<p>
I’m bringing my blog back — a space for notes, experiments, and thoughts on AI, ML, and the things that keep me curious.
