This is <strong>Rimon Rony</strong> — no fancy intros, just me.

<p>
Been messing with AI &amp; ML since before it was cool (and before everyone started
claiming their dog runs on GPT-7). Built a few things, broke a few more,
sold a couple, and somehow ended up still coding.
</p>

<p>
These days I work with others — helping machines pretend to be smart,
and humans pretend to understand them.
</p>

<p>
Not much of a social media person. I rarely post, never tweet,
and LinkedIn thinks I’m on a sabbatical.  
But sometimes I crawl out of my cave to do a keynote or two for my community.
</p>

<p>
Now I’m bringing my blog back — slowly, quietly, and with just enough sarcasm
to keep it fun.
</p>

<p>
You’ll find my notes, half-baked ideas, and random experiments right here at <strong>rimonrony.com</strong>.
